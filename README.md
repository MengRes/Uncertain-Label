# Uncertain-Label
This repository includes the introduction to uncertain labels in Chest X-ray diagnosis. We'd like to provide the introduction of our paper and dataset below.

The dataset introduction is updated to a new link: https://github.com/MengRes/MIMIC-CAD.



## Dataset Introduction

Our dataset is based on the MIMIC-CXR dataset. The MIMIC-CXR dataset provides Chest X-ray images and corresponding radiology reports. We extract labels from the reports and provide structured files to link our labels and CXR images.

You can download the dataset from: [Dataset Download](https://physionet.org/content/cad-chest/1.0/)

The dataset is stored in Physionet, before assessing the dataset, you may register the Physionet account and assign some related agreement.
